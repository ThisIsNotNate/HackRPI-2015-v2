Accomplishments-
Since this was our first Hack-a-thon, we were very proud to stay 
committed to the project until the end and make a somewhat functional game.
Along with this we were able to successfully use Github to send code to each
other.

What I Learned-
Writing this project really helped with imporving our ability to code in a team
and work with others to achieve a common goal. Along with this, we also learned
how to use github and how useful it can be to a team project.

What's Next?-
We have no future plans yet. We'll continue to further refine the game in the 
near future and proudly display it on github and devpost. We would love to 
submit this to Steam's Greenlight project but with the theme of our game and
some borrowed content we used in our assets from the internet, this may not
be possible due to copyright issues.
