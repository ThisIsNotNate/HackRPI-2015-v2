# HackRPI-2015-v2
#This was our project that we made at HackRPI 2015. It titled "v2" since this was our first attempt at using
#Github and things started to fall apart in the first iteration. 

#The game we created is titled "Ross". It's an arcade-styled, top down hack-and-slash style arena game. We created this game
#memory of Bob Ross who paassed away 20 years ago in November. In this game you use your chisel tool and paint brush to rid
#the world of some "unhappy" parts of nature. 

#To run the game you can download the code and run it from "Game.java" or download the .jar file and run it ffrom there.
#This was our first Hack-a-thon project and we hope to keep imporving and making better projects at Hack-a-thons in the 
#near future.
